These colours come from variables stored in the variables.modules.scss and exported through custom.scss.
Feel free to change and/or add new colours if you want to use the gradient in Hero.js line 23 instead of a random wallpaper generator.
If you prefere, you can test gradients in a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout
